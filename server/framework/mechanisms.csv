S.AC,Access Control (AC) Methods,"Access Control (AC) Methods are used to limit access to information and resources by enforcing a set of policies or rules. There are several AC methods used in information security, some of which are:

Role-based Access Control (RBAC): In RBAC, access to resources is based on the roles or functions that a user has within an organization. Users are granted permissions to perform specific tasks based on their roles, and those permissions are enforced by the system.

Mandatory Access Control (MAC): MAC is a security model where access to resources is based on the security classification of the resource and the clearance level of the user. The system enforces these rules and users cannot change them.

Discretionary Access Control (DAC): In DAC, access to resources is controlled by the owner of the resource. The owner decides who is granted access to the resource and what level of access they have.

Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC): ABAC is a model where access to resources is based on a set of attributes assigned to a user or resource. The system checks these attributes to determine whether access should be granted.

Rule-based Access Control (RuBAC): RuBAC is a model where access to resources is determined by a set of rules. These rules are defined by an administrator or security professional and enforced by the system.

These AC methods can be used separately or in combination to provide a comprehensive security solution for an organization.",1,,1,,AC methods are substantially absent.,"AC methods are present, however with limited configurability and capabilities.","AC methods are present, standard configurability and the ability to detect and correct threat events.","AC methods are present, fully configurable, and the ability to deter, prevent, detect and correct threat events.",,AC methods are not deployed.,Only a subset of AC methods have been deployed.,"The entire suite of AC methods have been deployed, however with inadequate performance considering organisation's requirements.","The entire suite of AC methods have been deployed, and performance is adequate considering organisation's requirements.",

S.AAA,Authentication-Authorisation-Accounting (AAA),"Authentication-Authorization-Accounting (AAA) is a security framework used to control access to information systems and network resources. The AAA framework consists of three distinct components, each of which is responsible for a specific aspect of access control:

Authentication: The authentication component is responsible for verifying the identity of users or systems attempting to access information systems or network resources. This is typically achieved through the use of usernames and passwords, digital certificates, or other authentication methods.

Authorization: The authorization component is responsible for determining what resources or services a user or system is authorized to access. This is typically achieved through the use of access control lists, role-based access control, or other authorization methods.

Accounting: The accounting component is responsible for tracking the actions of users or systems accessing information systems or network resources. This includes monitoring and logging events such as logins, logouts, file accesses, and other activities.",1,,1,,"An ISMS has not been provisioned, and no type of policy enforcement or segregation of duties.",ISMS has been provisioned; policy enforcement is provided using standard protocols; no segregation of duties.,ISMS has been provisioned; policy enforcement fully configurable; no segregation of duties.,ISMS has been provisioned; policy enforcement fully configurable; support for segregation of duties.,,An ISMS is not established; missing monitoring of controls efficacy; no auditing is performed.,An ISMS is established; monitoring of controls efficacy is performed; no auditing is performed.,An ISMS is established; monitoring of controls efficacy is performed; auditing is performed cross-organisation.,,
S.SSO,"SSO, MFA","SSO (Single Sign-On) and MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) are two security mechanisms used to control access to information systems and network resources.

SSO is a method of access control that allows users to authenticate once to a central identity provider and then be automatically signed into multiple applications or systems without the need for additional authentication. This can streamline the login process for users and reduce the risk of password-related security incidents, as users are not required to remember multiple usernames and passwords.

MFA, on the other hand, is a method of access control that requires users to provide more than one form of authentication to access a system or application. This can include something the user knows, such as a password, something they have, such as a security token or smart card, or something they are, such as a fingerprint or other biometric identifier. MFA provides an extra layer of security by requiring multiple forms of authentication, making it more difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems or applications.

Both SSO and MFA are important components of a comprehensive access control framework, and many organizations use both mechanisms to provide secure and efficient access to information systems and network resources.",1,,1,,"SSO, MFA and IWA are not available.","SSO and IWA are available, without support for MFA.","SSO and IWA are available, with support for MFA.",,,MFA is not deployed.,"MFA is deployed, with privacy preserving policies.","MFA is deployed, with security and privacy preserving policies.",,
S.IGI,Identity Governance and Intelligence,"Identity Governance and Intelligence (IGI) is a security framework that helps organizations to manage user access to information systems and network resources. IGI provides a centralized system for managing user identities, permissions, and access to applications and data.

The IGI framework typically consists of the following components:

Identity management: The identity management component is responsible for managing user identities, including the creation, deletion, and modification of user accounts, as well as user authentication and authorization.

Access management: The access management component is responsible for managing user access to applications and data. This includes the assignment and revocation of user permissions, as well as the enforcement of access policies.

Compliance management: The compliance management component is responsible for ensuring that the organization's access policies and procedures are in compliance with relevant regulations and standards, such as HIPAA or PCI DSS.

Analytics and reporting: The analytics and reporting component provides tools for monitoring user activity, generating reports on access policies and violations, and identifying potential security risks.

Overall, IGI provides a comprehensive framework for managing user access to information systems and network resources, helping organizations to improve security, streamline access management processes, and comply with relevant regulations and standards.",1,,1,,IGI does not allow integration with other systems,IGI provides connectors for compliance,IGI provides connectors for auditing,IGI provides connectors for compliance and auditing,,Connectors not deployed,Connectors deployed without periodic review,Connectors deployed with periodic review,,
S.ELS,Evidence of Layered-Security,"Evidence of Layered-Security refers to the documentation and demonstration of an organization's implementation of multiple layers of security controls to protect its information systems and network resources from cyber threats.

To provide evidence of layered-security, organizations may follow these standards:

Documentation: Organizations should have documented policies and procedures that outline the various layers of security controls in place, including firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, anti-virus software, access controls, and other relevant controls.

Testing: Organizations should regularly test and verify the effectiveness of their layered-security controls, using techniques such as penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and security assessments.

Training: Organizations should provide training and awareness programs to employees to ensure that they understand the importance of layered-security and are aware of their roles and responsibilities in maintaining a secure environment.

S.CP,Cryptographic protection,"Cryptographic protection refers to the use of cryptographic techniques to secure and protect data from unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure. Cryptography involves the use of mathematical algorithms and protocols to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data.

There are several cryptographic techniques that can be used to protect data, including:

Encryption: This involves transforming plaintext data into ciphertext using a cryptographic algorithm and a secret key. Only someone with the key can decrypt the ciphertext and recover the original plaintext.

Hashing: This involves using a one-way cryptographic function to transform data into a fixed-length output called a hash. Hashing is often used to ensure the integrity of data, as any changes to the original data will result in a different hash value.

Digital signatures: This involves using public key cryptography to create a digital signature that can be used to verify the authenticity of a message or document. The signature is created using the sender's private key and can be verified using the sender's public key.

Key management: This involves securely storing and managing cryptographic keys to prevent unauthorized access or use. Key management techniques include key generation, distribution, and revocation.",1,,1,,Encryption and key management are not covered by policies.,Encryption and key management are covered by policies and versionated.,,,,Encryption and key management are not reviewed or updated.,"Encryption and key management are reviewed and updated, but they are not covering the whole system.","Encryption and key management are reviewed and updated, and they are covering the major part of system.",,

SSO refers to a system that enables users to authenticate themselves once and then access multiple applications or systems without having to log in again. With SSO, users only need to enter their credentials once, and then they are automatically authenticated for all subsequent applications or systems they access.

Federated access management, on the other hand, allows users to access resources across multiple organizations or domains using a single set of credentials. Federated access management relies on the use of standard protocols, such as Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) or OAuth, to enable secure and seamless authentication and authorization across different domains.

Both SSO and federated access management provide several benefits, including increased productivity for users, simplified IAM processes for administrators, and improved security by reducing the need for multiple sets of credentials.",1,,1,,No segregation of duties (SoD) were considered.,Segregation of duties (SoD) is provisioned.,"Segregation of duties (SoD) is considered, as well as entitlement catalogue",,,,,,,
S.VM,Vulnerability Management,"Vulnerability management is a process for identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, and mitigating vulnerabilities in an organization's IT infrastructure. Vulnerabilities are weaknesses or flaws in software, hardware, or systems that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or disrupt operations.

The vulnerability management process typically involves the following steps:

Discovery: The first step is to identify all assets and systems within an organization's IT infrastructure. This includes hardware, software, network devices, and any other systems that could be vulnerable to attack.

Assessment: Once the assets are identified, the next step is to assess each one for vulnerabilities. This can be done using automated vulnerability scanners, penetration testing, or manual assessment.

Prioritization: After vulnerabilities are identified, they need to be prioritized based on their severity and potential impact on the organization. This helps to ensure that the most critical vulnerabilities are addressed first.

Remediation: Once vulnerabilities are prioritized, the next step is to develop a plan for remediation. This may involve installing patches, configuring systems correctly, or implementing other security controls.

Monitoring: Finally, it is important to continually monitor systems for new vulnerabilities and potential threats to ensure ongoing protection.",1,,1,,No vulnerability or patch management processes are considered.,"Vulnerability management and scoring is provisioned, however, without checklists and testing procedures.","Vulnerability management and scoring is provisioned, with corresponding checklists and testing procedures.",,,Vulnerability and patch are not deployed or not measured.,"Vulnerability and patch management is deployed, however, part of the system is still subject to critical issues.","Vulnerability and patch management is deployed, covering the entire system.",,
S.RR,Risk Response,"Risk response refers to the actions taken by an organization to manage and mitigate risks to its operations, assets, and reputation. Risk response involves identifying and evaluating risks, developing strategies to address them, and implementing controls to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk event.

There are four main strategies for risk response, known as the four T's:

Transfer: Transferring risk involves transferring the risk to another party, such as an insurance provider or a third-party vendor. This can help to reduce the financial impact of a risk event.

Treat: Treating risk involves implementing controls to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk event. This may involve implementing technical controls, such as firewalls or encryption, or operational controls, such as training or policies and procedures.

Terminate: Terminating risk involves eliminating the risk altogether by discontinuing a business process or activity that poses a significant risk to the organization.

Tolerate: Tolerating risk involves accepting the risk and its potential impact, while implementing controls to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk event.",1,,1,,No asset valorization and no risk assessment is performed.,Asset valorization is performed but no risk assessment is performed. ,Asset valorization nd risk assessment are performed.,,,No asset valorization and no risk assessment are reviewed.,Asset valorization is reviewed but no risk assessment is reviewed.,Asset valorization and risk assessment are reviewed. ,,

P.CDM,Collection and Data minimisation,"Collection and data minimization are two fundamental principles of data protection that organizations must adhere to when handling personal information. These principles are essential to ensure that organizations only collect and use personal information that is necessary for their business purposes, and that they do so in a transparent and lawful manner.

Data collection refers to the process of gathering personal information from individuals for specific purposes. To comply with data protection regulations, organizations must ensure that data collection is necessary, transparent, and lawful. They must also obtain the individual's consent to collect their personal information, or have another lawful basis for processing the data, such as a legal obligation or legitimate interest.

Data minimization refers to the practice of limiting the collection and processing of personal information to only what is necessary for the specific purpose. This involves analyzing the personal information that is collected and ensuring that it is relevant, accurate, and necessary for the purpose for which it is collected. Organizations must also ensure that they do not keep personal information for longer than necessary, and that they securely dispose of it when it is no longer needed.

By adhering to the principles of collection and data minimization, organizations can reduce the risks associated with handling personal information, such as unauthorized access or misuse. They can also build trust with individuals by demonstrating a commitment to protecting their privacy and personal data. Ultimately, these principles are essential for ensuring that organizations comply with data protection regulations and uphold the rights of individuals to control their personal information.",1,,1,,Purpose or rational for the data collection is not clear,Purpose and rational for the data collection are clear ,Minimal data collection is conducted to achieve the purpose and rationale,,,Data quality and provenance are not validated,Quality and provenance are validated for most of data,Quality and provenance are validated for all data,,

P.LAR,Limited attribute retention,"Limited attribute retention is a principle of data protection that involves retaining personal data attributes only for as long as necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. Personal data attributes are pieces of information that can be used to identify an individual, such as name, email address, or date of birth.

The principle of limited attribute retention is based on the idea that personal data should not be retained for any longer than necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. Once that purpose is achieved, personal data should be securely disposed of, deleted or anonymized to minimize the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, or breaches.

Limited attribute retention is an essential principle of data protection because it ensures that personal data is not held for longer than necessary, reducing the risks associated with the storage and processing of personal data. By deleting or anonymizing personal data attributes that are no longer needed, organizations can reduce the risk of unauthorized access or misuse, as well as mitigate the potential impact of data breaches.",1,,1,,No provision for data archiving or retention protocols,Provison for data archiving or retention protocols,,,,No compliance with European Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC,Compliance with European Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC,,,
P.RIP,Remote Identity Proofing and Non-Face-to-face Onboarding,"Remote identity proofing and non-face-to-face onboarding are two related concepts in identity verification that involve verifying an individual's identity without requiring physical interaction or face-to-face contact.

Remote identity proofing involves using digital identity verification methods to verify an individual's identity remotely, without requiring them to be physically present. This may involve using biometric data, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, or verifying personal data attributes, such as name, date of birth, and address, through public records or other sources.

Non-face-to-face onboarding is the process of onboarding new customers or employees remotely, without requiring them to be physically present. This may involve using remote identity proofing methods to verify the individual's identity, as well as other digital verification methods, such as document verification or video-based verification.

Remote identity proofing and non-face-to-face onboarding are increasingly used by organizations, particularly in industries such as financial services and healthcare, where there is a need to verify the identity of customers or patients remotely. These methods can provide greater convenience and accessibility for individuals, as well as cost savings and efficiencies for organizations.",1,,1,,"No provision for Combined Remote identity proofing methods, or other forms of identity confirmation.",Availabilit of Combined Remote identity proofing methods and forms of identity confirmation.,,,,Only plain identity proofing is deployed.,"Baseline assessment of the validity of identity proofs, with randomization of the identity proofing process.",,,

Personal data is any information that can be used to identify an individual, such as name, email address, or date of birth.

The principle of use limitation is based on the idea that personal data should only be used for the purpose for which it was collected, and not for any other purposes. This helps to protect the privacy and security of individuals' personal data, as well as prevent the misuse of personal data by organizations.

To adhere to the principle of use limitation, organizations must clearly define the purpose for which personal data is collected and ensure that it is only used for that purpose. They must also obtain the individual's consent for the specific use of their personal data, or have another lawful basis for processing the data, such as a legal obligation or legitimate interest.",1,,1,,No DUL is consideredDUL is considered,DUL is considered,"DUL is considered, also covering data processing",,, DUL not considers changes in purposes,"DUL is obtained for changes in purposes, only if compatible with the original",DUL is obtained for all changes in purposes,,

ID attributes are personal data elements that can be used to identify an individual, such as name, date of birth, address, social security number, passport number, and driver's license number.

To ensure that ID attributes collected are fit for scope and purpose, organizations must first define the specific purpose for which they are collecting the data. They must then carefully select and collect only those ID attributes that are necessary and relevant for that purpose. This means that any personal data collected must be directly related to and necessary for the purpose for which it is collected.",1,,1,,"ID cannot be revocated, updated, or renewed ",ID can be revocated,ID can be revocated and updated,,,"No Attribute-based encryption, no PIM, no inter-directory provisioning, no data mapping, no GDPR conformance","Attribute-based encryption applied, as well as Privileged Identity Management (PIM) services, are deployed.","Attribute-based encryption applied, Privileged Identity Management (PIM) services, in conformance with GDPR.",,

Identity proofing is the process of verifying an individual's identity to ensure that they are who they claim to be, and it is critical to many industries, such as financial services, healthcare, and government.

Some common issues that may arise during identity proofing include:

Technical issues: Technical issues, such as system downtime, connectivity issues, or software bugs, can prevent the identity verification process from proceeding smoothly. Troubleshooting technical issues may require IT support and expertise.

Data accuracy issues: Identity verification often relies on personal data attributes, such as name, date of birth, and address. If these data attributes are inaccurate or outdated, the identity verification process may fail. Troubleshooting data accuracy issues may require additional verification methods or validation processes.

Fraudulent activity: Fraudulent activity, such as identity theft or the use of fake credentials, can also prevent the identity verification process from succeeding.

E.DEC,Decisions are made in an appropriate manner based on users' consent,"Making decisions in an appropriate manner based on users' consent is an important aspect of data protection and privacy. User consent is typically required for the collection, processing, and sharing of personal data, and organizations must ensure that decisions are made based on the user's explicit and informed consent.

To ensure that decisions are made in an appropriate manner based on users' consent, organizations must implement measures such as:

Consent management: Organizations must implement consent management mechanisms that enable users to provide their consent for the collection, processing, and sharing of their personal data. These mechanisms should be clear, accessible, and easy to use, and should provide users with the ability to withdraw their consent at any time.

Consent verification: Organizations must verify that users have provided their consent before collecting, processing, or sharing their personal data. This may involve implementing technical measures such as pop-up consent forms or user authentication processes.

Consent auditing: Organizations must maintain a record of user consent for the collection, processing, and sharing of personal data, and must be able to provide evidence of user consent upon request.

Data minimization: Organizations must ensure that they only collect and process the personal data that is necessary for the specific purpose for which the user has provided their consent.",1,,1,,No Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) has been developed,A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) has been developed,"A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) has been developed, and customers awareness of automated decision-making.",,,Decisions do not follow GDPR guidelines.,The system satisfies Article 29 Guidelines and the limitation provided by Article 22 of the GDPR,,,

Security incidents may include data breaches, cyber attacks, system failures, or unauthorized access to personal data.

To react to security incidents against the EIDS, organizations can implement the following measures:

Incident response plan: Organizations should have an incident response plan in place that outlines procedures for responding to security incidents, including procedures for containing and mitigating the impact of the incident.

Incident investigation: Organizations should investigate the security incident to determine the cause and extent of the incident, and to identify any vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the EIDS that may have contributed to the incident.

Notification and reporting: Organizations should notify the appropriate stakeholders, such as users and regulatory authorities, of the security incident, and provide regular updates on the incident as it progresses.

REL.AL,EIDS sufficient Assurance Levels against Fraud risks ,"EIDS (Electronic Identity) sufficient assurance levels refer to the level of confidence or assurance that an electronic identity system has in the authenticity of a user's identity. The higher the level of assurance, the more confident the system is that the user is who they claim to be. This is particularly important in protecting against fraud risks, where a user may attempt to impersonate another user or create a fake identity to gain unauthorized access.

There are typically four levels of assurance in EIDS:

Level 1 - Low Assurance: This level of assurance provides a low degree of confidence in the user's identity. It may involve basic username and password authentication, which can be easily compromised by fraudsters.

Level 2 - Medium Assurance: This level of assurance provides a moderate degree of confidence in the user's identity. It may involve additional authentication factors, such as a security question or a one-time password sent to a registered phone number or email address.

Level 3 - Substantial Assurance: This level of assurance provides a high degree of confidence in the user's identity. It may involve in-person identity verification, such as presenting a government-issued ID card or passport.

Level 4 - High Assurance: This level of assurance provides the highest degree of confidence in the user's identity. It may involve multiple forms of identity verification, such as biometric authentication (e.g. fingerprint or facial recognition) and in-person identity verification.

By implementing EIDS with sufficient assurance levels, organizations can better protect against fraud risks and ensure that only authorized users are granted access to sensitive information or services. However, it's important to balance the level of assurance with user experience, as overly burdensome authentication processes can lead to user frustration and abandonment of the service.",1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
